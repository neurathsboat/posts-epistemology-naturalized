This ambivalence is encouraged by Quine's ambiguous use of "science", to mean sometimes, broadly, 'our presumed empirical knowledge' and sometimes, narrowly, 'the natural sciences'. Quine's modest naturalism is reformist, tackling the traditional epistemological problems in a novel way; his scientistic naturalism is revolutionary, requiring restriction and reconceptualization of epistemological problems. In particular, his scientistic naturalism trivializes the question of the epistemic standing of the natural sciences, whereas modest naturalism takes it seriously, and can offer a plausible answer.},

He is perhaps bestknown for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in particular,against its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction). This argument,however, should be seen as part of a comprehensive world-view whichmakes no sharp distinction between philosophy and empirical science,and thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the subject., In what follows, a very brief section on Quine's life andphilosophical work will be followed by an overview, which will serve toorient the reader. We shall not comment in any detail on Quine'swork in pure logic or set theory (for Quine's work on set theory,see Forster 2006). The third section is devoted to Quine'sarguments against the use that the Logical Empiricists made of theanalytic-synthetic distinction, and the view that he worked out to takeits place. The subsequent three sections go systematically throughQuine's own views; the final section is on Quine's place inthe history of philosophy.}

  abstract = {The term ``naturalism'' has no very precise meaning incontemporary philosophy. Its current usage derives from debates inAmerica in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed``naturalists'' from that period included John Dewey, ErnestNagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars. These philosophers aimed toally philosophy more closely with science. They urged that reality isexhausted by nature, containing nothing ``supernatural'',and that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areasof reality, including the ``human spirit'' (Krikorian 1944,Kim 2003)., So understood, ``naturalism'' is not a particularlyinformative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The greatmajority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalismas just characterized\textemdash that is, they would both reject``supernatural'' entities, and allow that science is apossible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truthsabout the ``human spirit''., Even so, this entry will not aim to pin down any more informativedefinition of ``naturalism''. It would be fruitless to tryto adjudicate some official way of understanding the term. Differentcontemporary philosophers interpret ``naturalism''differently. This disagreement about usage is no accident. For betteror worse, ``naturalism'' is widely viewed as a positiveterm in philosophical circles\textemdash only a minority of philosophers nowadaysare happy to announce themselves as``non-naturalists''.[1] This inevitably leads to a divergence inunderstanding the requirements of ``naturalism''. Thosephilosophers with relatively weak naturalist commitments are inclinedto understand ``naturalism'' in a unrestrictive way, inorder not to disqualify themselves as ``naturalists'',while those who uphold stronger naturalist doctrines are happy to setthe bar for ``naturalism''higher.[2], Rather than getting bogged down in an essentially definitionalissue, this entry will adopt a different strategy. It will outline arange of philosophical commitments of a generally naturalist stamp,and comment on their philosophical cogency. The primary focus will beon whether these commitments should be upheld, rather than on whetherthey are definitive of ``naturalism''. The important thingis to articulate and assess the reasoning that has led philosophers ina generally naturalist direction, not to stipulate how far you need totravel along this path before you can count yourself as a paid-up``naturalist''., As indicated by the above characterization of themid-twentieth-century American movement, naturalism can be separatedinto an ontological and a methodological component. The ontologicalcomponent is concerned with the contents of reality, asserting thatreality has no place for ``supernatural'' or other``spooky'' kinds of entity. By contrast, the methodologicalcomponent is concerned with ways of investigating reality, andclaims some kind of general authority for the scientific method.Correspondingly, this entry will have two main sections, the firstdevoted to ontological naturalism, the second to methodologicalnaturalism., Of course, naturalist commitments of both ontological andmethodological kinds can be significant in areas other thanphilosophy.  The modern history of psychology, biology, social scienceand even physics itself can usefully be seen as hinging on changingattitudes to naturalist ontological principles and naturalistmethodological precepts. This entry, however, will be concerned solelywith naturalist doctrines that are specific to philosophy. So thefirst part of this entry, on ontological naturalism, will be concernedspecifically with views about the general contents of reality that aremotivated by philosophical argument and analysis. And the second part,on methodological naturalism, will focus specifically onmethodological debates that bear on philosophical practice, and inparticular on the relationship between philosophy and science.},

But they have disagreed among themselves about how the axioms and the theorems they share settle long-standing disputes in the philosophy of science. After expounding these disagreements in the work of Boyd, Giere, Laudan, and Kitcher, I argue that naturalism needs to look for more than mere consistency in its foundations.},

I defend Quinean epistemology's objections to the epistemic pluralism associated with other self-styled naturalistic epistemologies, and show how recent theories in the philosophy of psychology which fail to account for the intentionality of psychological states in fact provide a cognitive foundation for an eliminativist epistemology which both honors Quine's strictures and helps us accommodate important findings and results in experimental psychology and cognitive science.},

Indeed, I'll maintain that the first of the three\textemdash the one I'll attribute to Quine\textemdash is simply incoherent. There is no way we could get what we want from an epistemological theory by pursuing the project Quine proposes. The second project on my list is a naturalized version of reliabilism. This project is not fatally flawed in the way that Quine's is. However, it's my contention that the sort of theory this project would yield is much less interesting than might at first be thought.},
