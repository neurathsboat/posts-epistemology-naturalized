## Introduction

>However far I go in my distrustful attitude, no actual harm will come of it, because my project won’t
affect how I act, but only how I go about acquiring knowledge. [...] This will be hard work, though, and
a kind of laziness pulls me back into my old ways.

[@descartesMeditationsFirstPhilosophy1614]

In this article, I will outline 
[W. V. O. Quine's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine) 
thesis on the development of a naturalistic approach in epistemology 
and the related discussion that has emerged from his proposal. 
I will also present my views on this venture.
The goals of this article are to explore the limits and required conditions 
of science in general and neuroscience in particular,
but also to assess to what extent the scientific study of the mind 
can contribute to the foundation of scientific practice itself. 
I chose to enter into such an endeavour 
through reconstitution of Quine's arguments 
as formulated mainly in the articles of “Epistemology
Naturalized” (Quine, 1969/2004) 
and “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” (Quine, 1951), 
and a selective review of articles from the later literature.
