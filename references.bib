  abstract = {Willard Van Orman Quine (1908\textendash 2000) worked in theoretical philosophyand in logic. (In practical philosophy\textemdash ethics and politicalphilosophy\textemdash his contributions are negligible.) He is perhaps bestknown for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in particular,against its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction). This argument,however, should be seen as part of a comprehensive world-view whichmakes no sharp distinction between philosophy and empirical science,and thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the subject., In what follows, a very brief section on Quine's life andphilosophical work will be followed by an overview, which will serve toorient the reader. We shall not comment in any detail on Quine'swork in pure logic or set theory (for Quine's work on set theory,see Forster 2006). The third section is devoted to Quine'sarguments against the use that the Logical Empiricists made of theanalytic-synthetic distinction, and the view that he worked out to takeits place. The subsequent three sections go systematically throughQuine's own views; the final section is on Quine's place inthe history of philosophy.}
